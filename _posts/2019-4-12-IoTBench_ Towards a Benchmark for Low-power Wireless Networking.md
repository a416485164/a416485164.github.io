# IoTBench: Towards a Benchmark for Low-power Wireless Networking

## Backgroundï¼š
Low-power wireless communication  needs
Lack of confidence in results
the divergence across experimental setups is even higher


## Definition
A benchmark typically defines input parameters representative of several application cases, output metrics quantifying the performance of the benchmarked systems, and possibly the required experimental setup.

## Goals
bring a standard and consistent way to test and compare low-power wireless networking protocols.
1, The benchmark should be reproducible across experimental settings.
2, The benchmark should be simple and minimalist.
3, The benchmark should suggest sufficient and appropriate experiments and metrics to improve the state of experimentation.
4, The benchmark should allow for consistent comparisons of low power wireless protocols across key metrics

In designing our benchmark, we would like the benchmark to be as general and representative as possible
and enable accurate, fair, and repeatable comparison pushes

Question is how to reconcile these conflicting goals.
1, The first step is the definition of parameters, metrics, and profiles,useful ways: guide system evaluation, qualify the results obtained


1,Parameters and metrics: Input parameters, Output metrics, Observed metrics;
2,Profiles: in the n-dimensional space determined by n input parameters
