## Main Content
The main contribution of this article is a surface touch technology, which uses a mobile phone microphone to locate touch points.In this paper, the author proposes UbiTap, an input method that turns solid surfaces into a touch input space, through the use of sound (i.e., with microphones already present in the commodity devices).The author develops a novel touch localization technique which leverages the physical phenomenon, referred to as dispersion, a characteristic of sound as it travels through solid surfaces, so as to address challenges which limit existing acoustic-based solutions in terms of portability, accuracy, usability, robustness, and responsiveness.
