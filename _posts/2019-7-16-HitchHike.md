# HitchHike:Practical Backscatter Using Commodity WiFi

***

## Abstract

We present HitchHike, a low power backscatter system that can be deployed entirely using commodity WiFi infrastructure. With HitchHike, a low power tag reflects existing 802.11b transmissions from a commodity WiFi transmitter, and the backscattered signals can then be decoded as a standard WiFi packet by a commodity 802.11b receiver. HitchHike's key invention is a novel technique called codeword translation, which allows a backscatter tag to embed its information on standard 802.11b packets by just translating the original transmitted 802.11b codeword to another valid 802.11b codeword. This allows any 802.11b receiver to decode the backscattered packet, thus opening the doors for widespread deployment of low-power backscatter communication using widely available WiFi infrastructure. We show experimentally that HitchHike can achieve an uplink
throughput of up to 300Kbps at ranges of up to 34m and ranges of up to 54m where it achieves a throughput of around 200Kbps.
